  "description": "Seika High School, previously an all-boys' school, has only been co-ed for a couple of years. The student population is still largely male—the boys outnumbering the girls four to one—and Seika High still has a bad reputation. And so Misaki Ayuzawa has decided to take things into her own hands, becoming Seika's first female student council president in order to clean up the school's act, improve it standing, and create a more welcoming environment for young women. Misaki rules over Seika with an iron fist, though not everyone appreciates her strength and intelligence or the changes she's making. Because of that, she's particularly careful to keep the fact that she works part-time at a maid cafe a secret; she doesn't want to ruin her image or risk losing what little authority she has. But then her classmate Takumi Usui discovers how she's spending her time after school. Misaki has caught his attention and interest, perhaps even romantically, though understandably she's not very happy about the awkward turn of events.",
